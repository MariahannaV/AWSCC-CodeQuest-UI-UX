#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer:
    
    â€£ Both platforms display the product instantly when you look it up in the search box. However, the top results from Lazada were from officialÂ stores, and the label "LazMall" (indicating that the store is legitimate) was easy to read because it was near to the product name, inÂ contrast to Shopee, where official and unofficial stores are unorganized that may confuse or become an inconvenience to users if they want to buy from official stores. As a result, it is simpler to find productsÂ from the official Lazada shop when searching for something using the search feature. 

     â€£ Upon scrolling, if the user is undecided which product they want to buy, Lazada and Shopee have similar structures. Lazada's homepage (on the web) instantly shows the categories of products that the user may choose from. In shopee, they focus more on getting the user's attention by displaying sales, discounts, and vouchers. Lazada's homepage also only features a few products for flash sales while Shopee shows the user flash sales, shopee mall, and top products. Other than that, they both showcase the products the user may be interested in.


-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer:

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer:

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Both websites, in my view, consistently showcase their brand. Lazada's color scheme is more subdued. Shopee's website tends to be more colorful. Whether navigating through the items or seeing them on the home screen, the brand colors remain consistent. 
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: Both platforms are responsive across different devices

    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: In terms of the website's aesthetics, I find that Lazada's design is more appealing than Shopee's since it is simpler.
